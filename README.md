# Artificial Neural Netweorks and Deep Learning Competition
In this repository you can find the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me - Giada Silvestrini - and my collegues - Ludovica Tassini and Giulia Venturini - to participate to the 2023/2024 competition of Politecnico di Milano course *Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning*, held by professors Matteo Matteucci and Giacomo Boracchi.

The competition was based on two different challenges:
- Image Classification
- Time Series Forecasting

## 1. Image Classification
**Goal:** build a binary classifier to correclty classify images of plants that were divided into two categories according to their state of health (1 = healthy, 0 = unhealthy).

**Dataset Deitails**: 
- Image size: 96x96
- Color space: RGB
- File Format: NPZ

**Evaluation metric**: Hidden testset accuracy

**Scores**:  

First phase: 91%  

Second phase:85%  

Points gained: 5

## 2. Time Series Forecasting
**Goal**: having 48000 univariate time series, divided into 6 different categories and each one with different length, the objective was to build forcasting models able to properly generalize the training dataset and correctly predict the next 18 samples. 

**Evaluation**: RMSE and MAE  

**Scores**:  

First phase: 0,0059  

Second phase: 0,0115  

Points gained: 5
